Project is to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. For the Toronto neighborhood data, 
a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information .For that I have to scrape the Wikipedia page and
wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like a dataset.
Using API collected the required data.
